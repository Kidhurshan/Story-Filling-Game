# 🎉 Story Filling Game 📝

Welcome to the **Story Filling Game**, a fun and interactive way to create hilarious stories using Python! 🎈 

This game reads a story template from a `Story.txt` file, prompts you to fill in the blanks (like `<adjective>`, `<animal>`, `<adverb>`), and finally outputs a completed and funny story! 😄

---

## 📚 How It Works

1. The program reads the story template from `Story.txt`.
2. It scans the template for placeholders marked as `<...>` (e.g., `<adjective>`, `<noun>`).
3. You are asked to provide replacements for each placeholder.
4. Your inputs are used to fill in the story, creating a unique and funny version!
5. The final story is displayed on the screen for everyone to enjoy. 🎭
